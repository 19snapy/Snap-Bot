# Snap-Bot
Discord bot with random commands from getting League of Legends player stats to CS:GO playerstats and more commands to come.
This project is ongoing and newer commands will be created from time to time.  
Some of the code may look funny with odd-looking indentation after I uploaded the files for some reason.

# For those who are planning to use this code
Install the latest version of node.js at: https://nodejs.org/en/  
Set-up the project by creating a directory, then locating it in command prompt (terminal for mac users) and type these in respectively:
`npm init` and `npm install discord.js`  

If i left something out please let me know.  

Make sure you made a discord application and set it to a bot.
Also make sure you have apikeys for both league of legends and steam.  
  
If you are not planning to use the league of legends command or the CSGO command, just simply delete the two js files or which ever one you dont want.

URL to creating discord application: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/  
URL to creating League API key: https://developer.riotgames.com/  
URL to creating Steam API key: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey  

After obtaining the discord token and the api keys, make sure you take all three keys and put them in the config.json files where its marked. Afterwards, the program should be usable by running the index.js file.
