# Snap-Bot
Discord bot with random commands from getting League of Legends player stats to CS:GO playerstats and more commands to come.
This project is ongoing and newer commands will be created from time to time.

# For those who are planning to use this code
Make sure you made a discord application and set it to a bot.
Also make sure you have apikeys for both league of legends and steam.  
If you are not planning to use the league of legends command or the CSGO command, just simply delete the two js files or whatever one you dont want.
